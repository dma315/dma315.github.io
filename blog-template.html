Reflection:

1. How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	
	Thought it was helpful, as usual, to hear how somebody else is thinking about their code and what they are thinking about when it comes to being creative.

	It was a bit more logistically challenging this time around, especially with the wireframing, but the HTML section was pretty solid. We got into a good discussion about the semantic elements, which I think was helpful to hear others' thoughts on. 

2. Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes, it was nice to have a template to work off of. I found myself referring back to it when trying to write the HTML code, so I was definitely using it in the "development" process.

3. What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
	
	We decided that the wireframe should have a few components.
		-The overall website header / footer (to be consistent)
		-A header section that makes the rest of the blog post navigatable
		-Sectioned off parts for each question

4. What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
	
	We used the <section> tags to help break up the sections. Admittedly, it's perhaps a little unclear still on how these will be used, but it seems like they are best practice for breaking up the code and making it more readbale. I can also see how it would be helpful for formatting, once we learn that.

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In this section, we'll cover the basics of editing information in cells. So far, we've been either adding new information into blank cells, or deleting cells entirely. However, you'll find throughout your Excel journey, that you'll often be editing cells that already have information in them. So rather than delete those cells entirely, you'll want to just edit parts of the information there.</p>

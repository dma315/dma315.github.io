			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Now that we are comfortable zooming around Excel without a mouse, we need to get comfortable entering information (it's kind of the point). In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of entering information quickly.</p>
			<p>Before we get started, you'll want to download the files below for this lesson:</p>

			<h3>Lesson 1:  Entering information vertically</h3>
			<p>Usually, after you are done putting some information in a cell, you will move on to another cell to enter more information. Not surprisingly, the <strong><em>Enter / Return</em></strong> key is what you press when you're done entering information and looking to information in a line <strong><em>below</em></strong> your current line.</p>
			<p>Try entering some information in a cell, press return, and see where your cursor moves in Excel. Once this makes makes complete sense, go ahead and complete the exercise.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Lesson 2: Entering information horizonttaly</h3>
			<p>Now that you can enter as much information going down as you want, you'll want to start moving right. To do this, after you're done with a cell, use the <strong><em>TAB</em></strong> key to move right.</p>
			<p>Spend some time putting this in your memory bank and complete the exercise once you're ready.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Lesson 3:  Entering information in all directions</h3>
			<p>All right, so I lied a little. As cool as Return and Tab are for entering information, they only move downwards or rightwards respectively. Sometimes, you'll want to move backwards. There are two ways to do this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You can hold <strong><em>SHIFT</em></strong> while pressing Return or Tab, to move up or left respectively</li>
					<li>Or you can just use the Up or Left arrow keys</li>
				</ol>
			<p>An aside on using Up and Left (and just down and right) is that in certain scenarios (e.g. when editing formulas) they <em>do not work</em>. This is the reason to learn Return and Tab, as they <em>always</em> work for completing information entry.</p>
			<p>Try these shortcuts out for a little and complete the exercise!</p>

			<h3>Lesson 4:  Deleting data</h3>
			<p>Now that you've created, you must learn to destroy. To do this, we want to use the <strong><em>Delete</em></strong> key. Depending on the version of Excel and what configuration of keyboard you have, there is a difference in functionality between <strong><em>Delete</em></strong> and <strong><em>Backspace</em></strong>, so make sure you try both of them to understand the differences.</p>
			<p>For this exercise, we'll revisit some of the multi-select and skipping cell lessons in the previous section to delete information in multiple cells at once. Make sure to keep those shortcuts in mind, so you aren't deleting every cell individually. And to get some repetition, undo your deletes <strong><em>(CTRL + Z on Windows / COMMAND + Z on Mac)</em></strong> a few times to make sure you are have this committed to memory.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>The Challenge</h3>
			<p>Now that we have learned to add and remove data from cells, we will practice a bit more with some math. In this section's challenge, we will build the multiplication table.</p>
			<p>Currently, there are letters going across and downwards in the grey cells. We obviously can't multiply letters, so replace the alphabet with the numbers 1 through 9 both horizontally and vertically and see what happens! Remember to only use your keyboard for this exercise.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The first step to learning Excel is to knowing you <a href="https://images.rapgenius.com/98ab7fa96fde508dc7eac47f7702a244.600x336x1.jpg">want to go fast</a>. This lesson is the beginning of that.</p>
			<p>In general, working in Excel is about being efficient, it's a powerful tool, so you won't want to limit yourself. Excel experts will tell you a few things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If anything is repetitively taking you more than 15 minutes, there's an easier way</li>
				<li>Avoid the mouse whenever possible. My first mentor told me to put my mouse on my left (I'm right handed) when learning Excel. You might want to try it to avoid reaching for it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I specifically cover these navigation pieces first because it'll be something you'll use in every exercise hereafter, and it'll make you faster once you get to doing any analysis. Excel has a cult following around its shortcuts, so much so that the lack of shortcuts on the Mac version or changing of shortcuts from one version to another has caused outrage from users. You can find a <a href="https://exceljet.net/keyboard-shortcuts">handy and nearly comprehensive list of them here</a>.</p>
			<p>Before we get started, you'll want to download the files below for this lesson:</p>

				</ul>
			<p>(A note on answers:  They are obviously here so you can see the completed exercise, but if you cheat and look ahead, you're only slowing down your learning.)</p>

			<h3>Lesson 1:  Moving around</h3>
			<p>When you open a blank Excel canvas, <a href="http://cdn.niketalk.com/0/07/350x700px-LL-07fd687b_9z66i.gif">anything is possible</a>, but the first thing you must do is walk. Excel is organized like a grid, where each individual "cell" has a coordinate. You can see these coordinates along the top and left side of your Excel window, where the columns are given letters, and the rows are given numbers. "A1", for example, refers to the top-left-most cell in your document.</p>

			<p>There are two ways to navigate from cell to cell in Excel:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><s>You can click and point at things with your mouse</s></li>
				<li>You can learn to use the keyboard</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To do this is fairly straight forward. We can use the directional arrow keys on your keyboard to move around from one cell to another. Try this a bit to get familiar, and when you feel like you have your legs (hopefully this will take ~60 seconds), move over to the right side of the "Lesson 1" box and enter your name in the grey boxes to complete the lesson.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Lesson 2:  Selecting multiple cells</h3>
			<p>Okay congratulations, now you can move around! However, notice that at any given moment, you are only at one coordinate (cell) at a time. This is great, but often times, you'll want to select multiple cells at the same time. Imagine being able to play battleship, but being able to sink the entire aircraft carrier in one turn. Excel can do this.</p>
			<p>To do this, just hold the [SHIFT] key while moving around. Play around with this for a bit and once you're comfortable, complete the exercise for Lesson 2.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Lesson 3: Skipping cells</h3>
			<p>All right, lesson 3, moving fast. This is perhaps the most important part of navigation. Lesson 1 taught us to walk. Lesson 2 taught us to be in multiple places at once. This lesson is about running.</p>
			<p>Excel is smart, and for any given cell you're in, knows whether there is information next to it. That is - it can skip to the end of all information or skip blank information to the next piece of information. Let's take two examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Example 1:  Cells A1 through A10 are all filled out (say with the numbers 1 through 10), Excel knows that A10 is the last filled out cell in column A.</li>
					<li>Example 2:  Cells A1 and A10 are filled out (say with 1 and 10), but all of the cells between them are blank. Excel knows that A10 is the first cell of information below A1.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>To navigate this, we use the:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><em>CTRL</em></strong> key on Windows</li>
				<li><strong><em>COMMAND</em></strong> key (&#8984;) on Mac</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Holding CTRL / COMMAND while using the arrow keys serves two main purposes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In Example 1:  It takes you to the last filled out cell in the direction you're moving. e.g. from A1 to A10 in one keystroke</li>
					<li>In Example 2:  It takes you to the first filled out cell in the direction you're moving (skipping all of the blank cells in between). e.g. again, from A1 to A10 in one keystroke</li>
				</ul>
			<p>Practice this a bit, try a few scenarios in a blank Excel sheet. And again, once comfortable, proceed to finish Lesson 3's exercise.</p> 
			<hr>

			<h3>Lesson 4: Changing sheets</h3>
			<p>The last shortcut for navigation! You'll find in this document, and many others you encounter, that there are multiple sheets (they look like tabs at the bottom of the page). This is of course to help us organize information in different areas and break up discrete pieces of analysis.</p>
			<p>We'll cover more about sheets later, but for now, we are interested in navigating them quickly and using our keyboard.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On Windows:  The best way to do this is using <strong><em>CTRL + (Page Up or Page Down)</em></strong>, where the + indicates holding CTRL down</li>
				<li>On Mac: There are two ways, either using <strong><em>FN + CONTROL + (Page Up or Page Down)</em></strong>, which mimicks Page Up / Down on Windows. Or, you can use <strong><em>Option + (Left / Right)</em></strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, take some time to familiarize yourself with these shortcuts, as they will be used frequently. Once it's in your muscle memory, proceed to complete Lesson 4's exercise.</p>

			<h3>The Challenge</h3>
			<p>Every section in this course will contain a "capstone" challenge that covers the concepts learned prior. In this case, we cover the lessons above. In general, the challenges will be related to real applications of the lessons learned, so you can get a taste of how you will use the skills. Also, anything from previous sections will be fair game for the challenges, to ensure that the learnings are being used and practiced throughout the course.</p>
			<p>In this section's challenge, we'll go through tab switching and skipping cells in more detail. Give it a shot!</p>

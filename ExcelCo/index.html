			<h1>Why would you take this class?</h1>
			<p>Hi, I'm David. I've spent the formative years of my career doing analytics. Sadly, this means that I wasted a lot of nights and weekends learning how to do things in Excel that could be taught in a weekend. I've taken Excel courses, I've learned from experts, and I've Googled a lot. What I've learned, though, is that there's no substitute for practice, research, and learning from others.</p>
			<p><em>Okay, so you've now just told me all the reasons why I shouldn't invest in an Excel course, why take this course now?</em></p>
			<p>In real life, not everyone has an expert to learn from, which means you either need to learn from the internet (daunting), find someone who can teach you (good luck), or take a course.</p>
			<p>My course focuses on a few things that you just won't find elsewhere:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Thinking</strong>:  Anybody can "learn" Excel, but it's much harder to learn to think. I'm going to teach you to <em>think</em> like an analyst</li>
				<li><strong>Research</strong>:  No Excel course can teach you everything, if they say they can, enjoy working on it for 3 months. My class gives you a <em>foundation</em>, it'll put you 80% of the way there, and show you how to navigate your way to the other 20%.</li>
				<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>:  If you want to just learn what Excel can do, go to Microsoft's website. If you want to be quick and accurate, and ultimately become a power user, start here. The first lesson is on abandoning your mouse.</li>
				<li><strong>Application</strong>:  Again, if you want to learn the functions, you can just Google them. The key is having real reasons, and I'll show examples of why you'd want to use certain functions</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Who takes this course?</h1>
			<p>Excel is a powerful tool that can be used in everyday life things (I'm not joking). This course is for anybody that's had to open a spreadsheet and find themselves unsure of what to do. That being said, it's designed to make you a power user, so if you're about to start a job where you know you'll be in Excel a lot, this course can prepare you for 99% of scenarios.</p>
			<p>People who might take this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The everyman</strong>:  Whether you are in sales, HR, doing administrative work, or just trying to keep track of your budget, this can help you save time and make your life more organized.</li>
				<li><strong>The analyst</strong>:  If you're starting in a job that's going to require you to crunch numbers, this is for you. Analysts, consultants, financiers, marketers, ops people, this is definitely for you.</li>
				<li><strong>The student</strong>:  If you work with data, or ever hope to work with data, or hope you DON'T have to work with data (you'll have to one day in almost any desk job), this is for you.</li>

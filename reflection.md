**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned a ton about these properties. I admittedly sunk a ton of time into getting the correct margins and getting the spacing right for my elements. 

I think the biggest takeaway from all of this is that padding, borders, and margin all essentially change the element's size, so using them carefully is key for actually getting things to show up in the right place. 

The other issue I ran into was that Chrome (Webkit) was adding its auto-margins and auto-paddings, which was making my spacing all messed up. I think that's the point of CSS resets?

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that positioning is REALLY hard. After I think grasping the different positioning components (absolute, relative, etc.), I still struggled with how they cascaded. Took a lot of tinkering to get this right.

The thing I found most helpful was building out big boxes of the site first with no content, no images, etc. And once those boxes are set, adding in the content. This was just a bit counter intuitive, since we already had HTML content. I found starting from scratch was easier than editing. 


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

I think the easier parts were creating the separate sections, like header, main, and footer. Adding images and text was easy and applying formats to those were easy.

I got obviously carried away with the hover functionality, which required a lot of boxes on top of each other, and getting the positioning for that was definitely challenging. 

The other part that was annoying was that doing in-line block spacing has a lot of default spacing, so I found a nice hack that uses unclosed list tags, but it really feels like a hack. Hope there's a better way to do this kind of stuff.

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that it takes A LOT of time. BUT, I think the key takeaway is that once you settle on some best practices and methods that work for you, it will be easier to make these types of changes going forward. Looking forward to learning more about this. I think the other thing that will be really helpful will be talking to full-time developers on best practices. Reading is a bit sporadic, it helps with some components, but getting insights from people who have been doing this would be excellent.

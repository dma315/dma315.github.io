      Version Control:  WHY???
      </b>
      <br><br>
      Because, that's why. As someone who's spent his career thus far living in Excel spreadsheets, paging through thousands of lines of data, there's nothing worse than not saving or waiting to work on a file while somebody else is making edits. And then to increase suffering, usually someone has to manually compile all of the files from everyone. Thank Google for Google Sheets (which of course come with all of its own issues).
      <br><br>
      That's where Git comes in. As someone just coming into the development world, but having spent a few months working with developers, I've seen the "epics" that teams have go one. We aren't talking about a 10 sheet model here, we're talking software that people actually use (zing). The benefits are obvious and Git does what nobody business person has figured out. 
      <br><br> 
      Here are my top reasons for using git, and more specifically using Github.
      <br>1. Changes are tracked:  But not in the v1, v2 kind of way. Every every change is named, dated, and marked up, so you can see EXACTLY what changed from one version to the next.
      <br>2. Change are forever: Oh, screwed something up. Just go back. As many versions as you want.
      <br>3. Changes are everywhere: Left your thumb drive at home? No problem, you can grab your changes from anywhere with Github.

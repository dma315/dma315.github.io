  DBC Week 5:  Enumerables and #group_by
  </div>

    <h4 class="emphasis">What are enumerables?</h4>
    <p>This week, we spent our time diving deeper into the world of enumerables. The word "enumerables" on its own doesn't appear to mean a lot, so I think it's important to cover what enumerables "do." Mixing in Ruby's definition and my own understanding, an Enumerable is best summed like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enumerables are methods, as in they do things to other things.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>In particular, what they do is iterate. That is - they go through a collection of things and "do" something to each thing in the collection.</li>
        <li>...which means that the things they "do" things to...happen to be "collection" things, like arrays, hashes, and ranges.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Because they work with collections, enumerables must have the ability to go through "each" thing in the collection. That is, the method "each" must be defined for any enumerable method.</li>
      <li>Since "each" must be defined, there often needs to be instructions for what to do within the "each". That is - a code block (or set of instructions or conditions) needs to be applied to the method.</li>
      <li>Finally, because enumerable methods tend to discover things about collections (often compare them), they need a comparison operator. This isn't the case for all enumerables, but is the case for certain methods like #sort, #max, or #min.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="emphasis">What are some enumerable examples?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>#count - which, as its name suggests, counts the number of things in a given collection</li>
      <li>#first - which again, as its name suggests, grabs the first itme in a collecton of things</li>
      <li>#select - which slightly less intuitively, rounds up all of the items in the collection, that are specified by a code block.</li>
      <li>To read more, <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html">Ruby has the shake down</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="emphasis">Aaaand on to #group_by</h4>
    <p>I like the concept of group by a lot because after you work with it enough in SQL, it becomes your best friend. In Ruby, it appears to be even more powerful.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="emphasis">#group_by</span> takes a collection (we'll use an array here as an example) and turns it into a hash.</li>
      <li>We also have to specify what exactly we are trying to group by. That is, what is the rule by which we are grouping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Say we have an example array below:</p>
    <pre>
<code>>> integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code></pre>
    <p>One thing we can do with group by is separate this set of numbers into evens and odds (is it divisible by 2 with no remainder, that is does n % 2 == 0). Here's how we'd do that and what it would output:</p>
    <pre>
<code>>> even = integers.group_by {|i| i%2 == 0}</code>
<code>=> {false => [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], true => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]}</code>
<code>>> p even[true]</code>
<code>=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code></pre>
  <p>Now go forth, imagine the possibilities!</p>

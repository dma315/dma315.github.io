  DBC Week 9:  Building a Website
  </div>

  <main class="blog-post">
    
    <h4 class="emphasis">Wow, 9 weeks</h4>
    <p>This week, as I reflect upon how the quickly the past 9 weeks has gone by, I think about how much I've learned already and how little I know so far. I've been working part time at a startup during this time and one developer gave me some great advice as I was telling him about how I don't know anything yet:</p>
    <blockquote>"Don't feel the need to belittle your abilities, the only difference between you and me is that I've been doing this for a lot longer. If you just do three things every day - write code, deploy code, and learn something new, you'll do great."</blockquote>
    
    <h4 class="emphasis">Website Building Reflection</h4>
    <p>This website building process has been a great experience for me so far. The things I've really enjoyed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Actually learning HTML / CSS vs. just hacking away at it (anybody remember MySpace?)</li>
      <li>A real focus on design. I didn't realize that we'd spend time thinking about design, and that mindset was tremendously helpful as I started to create my site</li>
      <li>Constantly being exposed to new technologies.  Between finally incorporating JavaScript, then learning JQuery, and adding some Bootstrap - it's been great building upon what we started and seeing it evolve</li>
      <li>And finally, it's been a great reflection process. Looking back at the site I created in week 2 versus where we are now, it's amazing to see how far it's come (and how many revisions its been through)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That being said, there have also been parts that are quite excruciating.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>As someone who is not really patient, there are so many things I'd love to do with this site that I haven't quite been able to figure out yet.</li>
      <li>I'm also not great at timeboxing or pseudocoding. I like just diving in and getting going, which has certainly bitten me a few times. I've scrapped and started over more times than I'd like to admit.</li>
      <li>And design. Design is hard. I can't seem to settle on a color scheme and have maybe changed mine a dozen times. And I'm still not satisfied. A lot of respect for those who do this and have an eye for it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="emphasis">What have I learned</h4>
    <p>Besides learning about the tech that goes behind creating a site, I think I learned more about the process and about myself. The process, in the sense that it takes a lot of thought and effort to make even the simplest choices and implement them. Patience is hard to come by, but it's definitely required when trying to build. And about myself, it's that I'm not patient, and I need to be. It's easy to dream, but to build the dream is a lot tougher and requires me to set aside time and a lot of mental effort. It's been a great 9 weeks and I've learned a ton. Bring it on Phase 1.</p>
